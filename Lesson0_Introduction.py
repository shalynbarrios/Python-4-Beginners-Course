# Hello, world!

# This is Shay's Introduction to Python Course.
# Let's jump right in.

# -------------
# Hello, world!
# -------------

# Why did I start with the phrase "Hello, world!" ?

# In 1972, computer scientist Brian Kernighan's tutorial for programming started
# by instructing students to write their following first line of code:

print("Hello, world!")

# Try it! Type it in your notebook and hit run.

# I want you to ALWAYS type out what I type in your notebook.
# The best way to learn is by doing. 
# THIS MEANS DON'T COPY PASTE ! :)

# So follow the tradition, and type print("Hello, world!").

# Output: Hello, world!

# What is the computer doing?
# The computer is "reading" your code, line by line, top to bottom, left to right.
# This is Python's execution order.

# Code executes left to right, top to bottom, as standard English is read.
# You will find that Python is a very readable language. Perfect for beginners!

# -------------
# The Print Function
# -------------

# What does print("Hello, world!") exactly mean?

print()

# ^ This is the print function.
# A 'function' is a fancy word for "action."
# The computer comes with predetermined basic functions or "actions."
# So the print function is a specific action that the computer already knows what to do when you type it.

# This print function prints whatever you would like into the terminal (the terminal is where you saw the previous output)

print(5)

# This code will print the number 5 into the terminal.
# How? By running the print function, and inside the function, there is the number 5

# -------------
# The Print Function: Words
# -------------

# In Python, words are known as "strings"
# A good way to remember this terminology is to think:
# A word is a "string" of characters.

print("Hello!")

# So with Python terminology,
# This print function prints the string Hello! into the terminal.

# But Shay, what if I wanted the function to print with quotes?

print("'Hello!")

# This print function prints the string 'Hello!' into the terminal.

# Now, I want you to understand takes everything you say 100% literal
# What do I mean by that?

print("5")

print("5000+2000")

# Even though you and I interpret this as the number 5, 
# Python interprets this as a string 
# Because remember, a string is a string of characters.

# -------------
# Recap
# -------------

# We learned that:
# -- Python reads left to right, top to bottom
# -- We can display information into the terminal by using the built-in print function
# -- Words as you and I know them are known to Python as "strings"

# Challenge

print("Hello!")
print("These strings are going to be printed from 1 to 3.")

print("1")
print("3")
print(2)

# Challenge: Solved

print("Hello!")
print("These strings are going to be printed from 1 to 3.")

print("1")
print("2")
print("3")
